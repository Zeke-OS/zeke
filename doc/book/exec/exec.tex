\part{Executable File Formats}

\chapter{Introduction}

The kernel has a support for implementing loader functions for any new
executable format but currently only 32bit \acf{elf} support exist. 
Loading of a new process image is invoked by calling exec syscall call that
calls \verb+load_image()+ function in \verb+kern/exec.c+ file.
Process image loaders are advertised by using \verb+EXEC_LOADER+ macro.

\section{Memory Map}

Memory map of an executable loaded in Zeke is defined by the exec subsystem.

\chapter{ELF32}

The \acs{elf} loader in Zeke can be used to load statically linked executables
as well as anything linked dynamically. Currently only two loadable sections can
be loaded, code region and heap region.
