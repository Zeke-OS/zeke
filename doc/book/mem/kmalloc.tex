\chapter{kmalloc}

The current implementation of a generic kernel memory allocator is largely
based on a tutorial written by Marwan Burrelle\cite{Burelle:malloc}.

\section{Brief Description}

The current kernel memory allocator implementation is somewhat naive and
exploits some very simple techniques like the first fit algorithm for allocating
memory.

The idea of the first fit algorithm is to find a first large enough free block
of memory from an already allocated region of memory. This is done by traversing
the list of memory blocks and looking for a sufficiently large block. This is
of course quite sub-optimal and better solutions has to be considered in the
future. When a large enough block is found it's split in two halves so that the
left one corresponds to requested size and the right block is left free. All data
blocks are aligned to 4 byte access.

Fragmentation of memory blocks is kept minimal by immediately merging newly freed
block with neighboring blocks. This approach will keep all free blocks between
reserved blocks contiguous but it doesn't work if there is lot of allocations of
different sizes that are freed independently. Therefore the current implementation
will definitely suffer some fragmentation over time.

When kmalloc is out of (large enough) memory blocks it will expand its memory
space by allocating a new block of memory from dynmem. Allocation is commited in
1 MB blocks (naturally) and always rounded to the next 1 MB.

Descriptor structs are used to store the size of the data block, reference counters,
and pointers to neighbouring block descriptors.


\section{Suggestions for Further Development}

\subsection{Memory allocation algorithms}

The current implementation of kmalloc relies on first-fit algorithm and variable
sized blocks, that are processed as a linked list, which is obviously inefficient.

One achievable improvement could be adding a second data structure that would
maintain information about free memory blocks that could be used to store the
most common object sizes. This data structure could be also used to implement
something like best-fit instead of first-fit and possibly with even smaller
time complexity than the current implementation.

\begin{eqnarray}
\mathrm{proposed\_size} &=& \mathrm{req\_size}
  + \frac{\mathrm{curr\_size}}{\mathrm{req\_size}} \mathrm{o\_fact}
  + \frac{\mathrm{curr\_size}}{o\_div}.
\end{eqnarray}

\begin{algorithm}
  \caption{krealloc over commit}
  \label{algo:realloc_oc}
  \begin{algorithmic}
      \If{$\mathrm{req\_size} > \mathrm{proposed\_size}$}
        \State $\mathrm{new\_size} \gets \mathrm{req\_size}$
      \Else
        \If{$\mathrm{limit}_{min} < 4 \frac{proposed\_size}{req\_size} < \mathrm{limit}_{max}$}
          \State $\mathrm{new\_size} \gets \mathrm{proposed\_size}$
        \Else
          \State $\mathrm{new\_size} \gets \mathrm{max(req\_size, curr\_size})$
        \EndIf
      \EndIf
  \end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

Figure \ref{figure:realloc} shows "simulations" for a over committing realloc
function. This is however completely untested and intuitively derived method
but it seems to perform sufficiently well for hypothetical memory allocations.
